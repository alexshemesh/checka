### Monthly bills
Alex likes to optimize things so he needs app to manage his budget.
Big payments aside there is a lot of small transactions that are hard to keep track.
The only reliable way is to collect bills and insert them to some excell form.
Its can be optimized.
Alex needs simple application that will collect all the bills and store them with date.
It will try to parse actual bill and calculate total price and name of the business.
But if it fails to parse data its still huge help because all bills are stored to digital db.
Everything should be protected somehow. Its not very secret information but lets keep it private.
